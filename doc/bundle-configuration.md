===========================

[Back to menu](../README.md) / [Back to installation](./bundle-installation.md)

## Configure on SF 4.1 and greatest

This is the available configuration for the bundle

In `config/packages/graph_client.yaml`
```yaml
graph_client:
    sources:
        paths: # Can be not configured
          queries: "" # By default it's ["{$this->kernelRootDir}/Resources/graphql/queries"]
          fragments: "" # By default it's ["{$this->kernelRootDir}/Resources/graphql/fragments"]
        extension: "" # By default it's ".graphql"
    api: # All thees elements must been configured 
        host: "" # The host
        uri: "" # The api uri to contact
        token: "" # The token generated by mutation on the api
    logging_enabled: false # If you want to log queries to see in the debug toolbar
```

In dev mode `config/packages/dev/graph_client.yaml`
```yaml
graph_client_bundle:
    logging_enabled: true
```

No you can use the bundle. If you want to change the queries cache adapter, 
it's simple to do [here](./bundle-query-service.md)

If you want to directly use the service, you can check the [usage doc](./bundle-usage.md)

## Configure on SF 3.4 or 4.0

This is the available configuration for the bundle

In `app/config/config.yml`
```yaml
graph_client:
    sources:
        paths: # Can be not configured
          queries: "" # By default it's ["{$this->kernelRootDir}/Resources/graphql/queries"]
          fragments: "" # By default it's ["{$this->kernelRootDir}/Resources/graphql/fragments"]
        extension: "" # By default it's ".graphql"
    api: # All thees elements must been configured 
        host: "" # The host
        uri: "" # The api uri to contact
        token: "" # The token generated by mutation on the api
    logging_enabled: false # If you want to log queries to see in the debug toolbar
```

In dev mode `app/config/config_dev.yml`
```yaml
graph_client_bundle:
    logging_enabled: true
```
